I've only gotten one so far I don't know why,bad
they changed the magazine and it's just trash. i canceled my subscription.,bad
sucks (period),bad
"waste of my money and worse, waste of my time.....",bad
This magazine has become so boring! Disappointed in the content and reviews.,bad
Allure sent me 3 magazines in the space of a month in order to get rid of back issues. Very disappointed.,bad
Minimal content. A very diffrent magazine than several years ago,bad
Doesn't support my Kindle paperwhite,bad
I was subscribed to the magazine for many years and USED to love it.  I hate this kindle edition.  All ads.  Cannot find a place to unsubscribe.  Help !,bad

This is the normal price you would pay /yr times 2 yrs.",bad
Does not work on Kindle for WP.,bad
"We ordered it in December, its now the end of February, the 10 weeks are up.  Where is the magazine?",bad

"Order this and a subscription to Computer Shopper on Dec 28 2001, got my Computer Shopper in Jan 2002, still have not seen a issue of Maximum PC as of end of Arril.",bad
This is a magazine made of clowns! Bozo rules! I friendly advice to people is to get almost any other magazine. This one is completely lost.,bad
Advertising in this publication is based around sex appeal.  Not a healthy outlook.  Promotes sex out of marriage.,bad
"Do not buy. You get a 4 or 5 issues, then they stop. Contacted Amazon, got 1 more issue then they stopped again. A rip off. We need a NO star option.",bad
magazines may have gone digital but that makes their ads even more annoying--it takes way too long to get to the stories and by then I don't want to read it.,bad
Love the mag but it doesn't work on my Kindle due to there update and they haven't fixed the problem !!!! They just give you the run around!!,bad
I have received ANY issues yet!,bad
far too many adds  not enought info,bad
"Order it in March and only receive 2 copy so far, will never order any magazine every again.",bad
"As such, I am unable to review it.

However, I can review the ship time and I am not pleased with it at all.",bad
Faulty DRM would not allow me to view the magazine on my Fire HD. Was forced by the app to remove the magazine.  Seriously annoyed.,bad
I have yet to recieve this magazine and I ordered it almost 2 months ago!,bad
It took two months to receive the first magazine and didn't receive any more after that.  Defenitely the last magazine subscription I order from Amazon.,bad
This is a great magazine if I was younger in age!,bad
"I used to love this magazine because it was fun and fashion. Now, it's gotten all political and ""edgy."" Blah.",bad
"The magazine is good, but I didn't order a subscription.",bad
Once I was able to download it told me that it was a protected copy and had to be deleted from my kindle.,bad
I didn't order this.  Why do I have it?,bad
This magazine is a waste of money and bores me.  Nothing here to see but ads.,bad
"Some content was really good, but the adds to content balance just didn't work for me.  Pretty sure it was at least 60/40 ads to content.",bad
"sucks
you may or may not receive you order",bad
Waste of money never down loaded on my fire,bad
"Tooooooo many ads, first 45 pages all ads then table of contents then more ads",bad
"Did not order this, I hate magazines.",bad
"Not interested, too many adds.",bad
This magazine is about 70% advertisements.  It's a shame.  I canceled my subscription.,bad
Once upon a time this was a great magazine. That was years ago. Now it is full of ads and recycled articles. They haven't had anything new or worth reading in a long time.,bad
I got carpel tunnel syndrome just trting to get through the ads. Not happy.,bad
"This app needs work as it will only download the first few pages then ""gets stuck"".  Glad I only bought one issue and I will delete that.",bad
"Do not download, Did not download all the way for me and still was charged very disappointed will not download again",bad
"Rubbish
Full of ads",bad
Won't buy again. Too many advertisements.,bad
I get this magazine and comments are Right..Nothing but ads! If I wanted to see ads I would just watch TV!,bad
"not like use to.  Too much ads, (every page?)  no thanks",bad
Thought this was a monthly magazine. Buyer receivies one mag every 3 months. Every three months one can almost forget they ordered the magazine.,bad
Love the mag but doesn't work on my Kindle due to there update and they give you the run around and don't fix the problem!!!,bad
Would have been great to receive more than two issues. Seems to be a common issue.,bad
Did not find it worthwhile,bad
So sad that a historical magazine has declined,bad
85% of each issue is ads. I have a subscription to it so I just put it in the recycle bin each time I get it. Pretty disappointing the lack of content!,bad
I am very displeased with this.  I tried to cancel my subscription but they would not do so.  I do not want this magazine.,bad
I have not received the magazine yet!! It was paid on September. 14th!!! Not happy!! It is now October 18th!!!!,bad
Paid for a year and only received 2 magazines in 6 months!,bad
This only came for two months and then just stopped... not a very good mag anyway,bad
Not available  for purchase? Why list it under Kindle Unlimited  then?,bad
Good luck reading this on a smart phone or kindle. The text is so small you'll spend half your rine pinching the screen and the other half cursing.,bad
Not compatible on Android tablets via Kindle app.  Beware...,bad
Received an issue around thanksgiving and then nothing.,bad
"I take offense to the description ""guide for the woman"" Men read your magazine too!",bad
"Garbage for gullible people.  Self esteem will result from positive relationships and service to others, not physique.  This drivel will only damage your health, not improve it.",bad
Articles are no longer very interesting.  Basically you can get all the highlights of the articles online for free.,bad
Very disappointing as every turn of the page there is full page advertisements. Hardly any articles and not impressed with them.,bad
I bought this for my kids but quickly cancelled after seeing all the tobacco ads.,bad
Got 1 or 2 issues! Waste of money,bad
magazine has too many adds not enough mens health,bad
"A short magazine with overly simply articles. Number of ads seems more than normal.
Love the web site and very disappointed in this magazine.",bad
Magazine is nothing but advertisements,bad
"Great magazine until they lose your subscription information half way through the subscription, and then ask you if you're not talking about some other magazine. Amazing really.",bad
Still am waiting on the magazine when I got an email a month ago saying it was being processed and I should get it shortly,bad
"I decided to test out the magazine with 4 issues for .99, then get charged. I only got 2 and it tried to charge me. No way.",bad
Expect 95% ads 5% actual content.,bad
I subscribed to a magazine that is mostly advertisements.  Little information compared to ads for other products.,bad
Most of what I seen was lots of advertising...rather have the real magazine..,bad
"Purchased this item, but it wouldn't download.",bad
Not very interesting.,bad
"Got the first issue and then cancelled.  Lots of health info followed by a FULL PAGE AD FOR CIGARETTES.
Can you say hypocritical !!!!",bad
I didn't order this,bad
Not satisfied!!!! Didn't recieve s***. I got scammed. Smfh,bad
I don't like this one so cancelled my subscription.,bad
I bought this for my husband and paid $15 for two years. We have gotten 1 issue in 3 months and 5 bills saying we owe $10. This is an awful deal.,bad
Charged twice so cancelled. Refunded only the one charge. Lesson Learned.,bad
The magazine has seemed to take a slightly homosexual slant. I will not purchase it again because i don't think it represents who i am as a man anymore.,bad
"Only received one issue.  Great magazine, bad deal.",bad
Tried to cancel the auto subscription but was unable too!!!!! Suggest buying from another source.,bad
I purchased a digital and print subscription and my kindle had only received one copy of men's health.,bad
Just don't like the format on my tablet,bad
Nothing but ads,bad
Never ordered this mag???,bad
I think there are a lot of useless articles.  The cabbage recipes were unappetizing.  I was glad I didn't buy it.,bad
I haven't received an issue yet.,bad
Boring. Mostly goofy ads,bad
Last issue warning after six months. Not renewing.,bad
I ordered this for my son but he has yet to receive it!,bad
Constantly has to re download. Basically unreadable.,bad
A waste of time and trees.  All about pushing ads and products. Few really useful articles. Won't renew.,bad
can't seam to inlarge type.,bad
Ordered Magazine in March 2016 and finally got my 2nd copy today dated September 2016.  The first copy was around May 2016.,bad
Politically skewed magazine. Nothing groundbreaking to read about.,bad
"Try though I may, ""Read For Free"" does not work. Poor fate for late date?",bad
"This magazine contains tobacco advertisements. Wouldn't be a problem, but I ordered it for my son.",bad
"i ordered  men's health for someone incarcerated,  i year subscribtion., out of  that year they only received 2 magazines.",bad
I paid for the subscription and I only got one issue. I kept waiting and nothing! Disappointed customer.,bad
"I cannot read this magazine with all of the ads. Every other page is an ad. You get half of the magazine, maybe. Some pages have ads on both sides. Go for HGTV Magazine instead.",bad
do not want,bad
Only got 2 of the magazines,bad
"If you are looking for wall to wall coverage of Global Warming then look no further, not a lot else to offer.",bad
"Like the Mag but got it so I could view it on like too
That doesn't  work when you buy it form Amazon",bad
Gave it as a gift that had been asked for. I apologized for the content and he agreed it was not what he had expected.,bad
"This is the same reason I stopped buying the printed version years ago, more informative articles are required...especially for the everyday man.",bad
mostly useless information and way too many ads small in comparison to what they used to be.,bad
would like to discontinue mt subscription,bad
An entire issue devoted to global warming. Really...,bad
Very rudimentary publication. Would not order again.,bad
Expected more substance.,bad
"I'm writing a one point review because I never did get the magazine on my kindle.  Wow I thought I subscribed to it a while ago.  Please correct.
Diane Boyle",bad
I haven't gotten any issues yet.,bad
"Ridiculous. Show a few recipes and a couple pictures of $25,bad00 kitchens and you've got this magazine. The rest is nothing but ads for depression and erectile dysfunction.",bad
Renewal w/o notice.,bad
"Definite room for improvement... they are still sending my magazines to my parent's house, after repeated phone calls and account updates.",bad
Don't waste your time unless you have a kindle fire or ipad.  Kindle apps on android phones or tablets are not allowed to load this kindle item.,bad
The magazine is mostly ads. Not worth paying to read ads.,bad
You keep sending it to the wrong address and it is present to some else.  I am trying to correct this.,bad
Didn't have,bad
Received my first two issues on the same day. One i had already purchased a month earlier and the other was the prior months issue! I won't buy subscriptions from here anymore.,bad
Cancelled my subscription once they thought they were the liberal media on twitter. We get enough politics I just wanted science,bad
"Poor writing, and includes a ridiculous full-page ad for male sexual enhancements.  Don't give this to kids.",bad
"This magazine has gone to,,,you know the emoji with flies circling.",bad
Poor articles and tons of ads. I cancelled my subscription.,bad
"Useless, more political than scientific, WAY to many ads.  Don't subscribe.",bad
"I got bombarded with glossy junk mail and watch out for hidden renewals.
My wife got me a subscription through her airline miles program. I did not like it.",bad
Disappointed to learn that I can view my print subscription online. I've done enough with BGH.,bad
Doesn't work on Kindle Paperwhite 7th Generation,bad
"I am dissapointed at the fact that I only got one magazine. I am gonna try again.
I wonder what happened to my money",bad
Terrible. Will not fully download. Worked fine until recently. Last two issues only download a few random pages.,bad
I haven't recieved a single copy so I can't really review it. All I can say is the amazom service is terrible.,bad
"Unfortunately, I must give this magazine a O as I have yet to recieve an issue.",bad
wanted decor not recipes,bad
"I always look forward to BHG and Dr Harry especially.
Tonight I saw all sorts of depressing junk about Halloween
I turned it off...",bad
Did not get this magazine. Gail,bad
I would. Like it much better if I could expand it  to be able to read in larger print cannot read all articles very disappointed,bad
"unlike my other magazine subscriptions, I'm unable to expand the page, unable to read it, plan to cancel.",bad
A little to basic and simple,bad
Very bad. You don't get to read the magazine because it keeps downloading for ages. Another way of extorting money from innocent subscribers.,bad
"Extreme Liberal bias, not worth reading anymore",bad
"I cannot get the digital version to download and I wound up being charged for it twice, I use to get it free with my subscription to the paper mag, what gives???",bad
Boring ! There isn't any information in here that is valuable and will pertain to improving the beauty of your home inside or outside.,bad
Stick to the print version.  The digital version is disappointing.,bad
"In this day and age, it seems like I would have seen an issue before now...it's been over a month.  I know I like the magazine, I'd just like to get it.",bad
I got two issues in 1.5 years and they said its up for renwal. Do not buy,bad
"like the magazine, but i will not load, what a waste of money",bad
"I know it says ""large file, may take longer to download"" but really - it's been three days and its still downloading!",bad
Great magazine but sooo many problems with the app. BHG has some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. No more for me- I'm going back to hard copies.,bad
"Used mag before I recieve mag people read

Cole was here,bad
"Most of our family on our account has the original Kindle Fire, which this isn't compatible with. Really stupid. Will not renew because only one of us can read it.",bad
The new Better Homes App on the Kindle is a pain.  The downloading is slow and incomplete.  The old process was much faster.,bad
"I look forward to checking the latest issue every month.  With this new edition, the magazine has been downloading for 3 days.  It is a technical problem.",bad
"The magazine is on the device but to open it, I wait for page downloads that sometimes never happen. Other publications work fine",bad
I received only two issues and have not been able to download the next issue. I do not seem to have any avenues to resolve my subscription issues.,bad
I am unable to access the magazine. I'm being asked to sign in with information I don't have. App not working for me at all.,bad
Not enough stories to many advertisements,bad
Too advanced for my daughter.  I thought it was for elementary students,bad
The font was too small I Found it hard to read .and it was too liberal I did not beleave a lot of what was written.,bad
"If I ordered this, it was by mistake!",bad
Never got the digital version,bad
Still don't like the format.,bad
Canx my subscription....way too much advertisement!  Keep in mind though. I hate commercials!  Only exception is Superbowl!,bad
"I have Reason on my Kindle, then I ordered it for my Windows phone, but it has not appeared on my phone yet!!!",bad
It took forever to get 1 issue! will never order again!,bad
Cancelled. Did not have type of content and interest I recalled from long-term subscription from years ago.,bad
Can't say it met expectations even though it has been paid for in April but will not receive my first copy until July.  Not the best way to handle subscripons.,bad
The magazine is so thin -- not much articles to read in this issue.  Will the coming issues also be this thin?,bad
Two and a half months waiting for first magazine...No customer service access to find out why...they where quick to take my money though!!!,bad
Obama the worst president we have,bad

"Unfortunately, it's nothing more than more conservative propaganda. I was really hoping it would not be, but it's undeniably just that.",bad
"Disappointing on the home sections.  HGTV magazine is more to my liking.
I will not buy this again. Money not well spent.",bad
I found the point of view from this journal much too conservative for my taste.  It is probably best for libertarians.,bad
The magazine CAN'T be read on a Kindle! I bought it and the publisher decided to NOT make it available for the Kindle...,bad
"I ordered 12/16/09, as if 02/12/10 (8 weeks) I haven't received the first issue.  It's taking too long.",bad
If you believe in global warming and other liberal views---this magazine is for you.,bad
Please avoid Reason.  The good work they do is negated by their betrayals and attacks on others in the Liberty movement.  Reason needs to fire their senior editors.,bad
"I cannot rate higher because I won't receive my first issue until July.......what a long time to wait.
But I'm sure it will be fine.",bad
Dishonest!,bad
I have never gotten this product so it's hard to know how to rate it.  Wish amazon would send me things in a timely manner.,bad
There are way to few helpful articles in these PC World and some others. 80% ads and it's a waste of trees to make the paper.,bad
"Wow, Ordered about two months ago, and still no magazine.
If you want a subscription to start at a reasonable time after ordering, go through the publisher!",bad
I ordered this on 12/23/08 as a gift and the person still has not received their first issue as of 2/3/09.  Very disappointed.,bad
"Seriously Popular Science, I am done subscribing, I have been a subscriber for YEARS and it's like 99% ad's these days. Forget it, I am done",bad
perhaps my expectations were too high.  Disappointed.,bad
"they automatically renew even after you cancel it and repeatedly bill you , they have done it to so many people do your research before buying",bad
What I hate is that I NEVER GOT IT!  I am sure I would be satisfied if/when it shows up!,bad
boring and full of ads.  Not what I thought it would be.  Waste of money.  Cancelled it,bad
"How may I give a less than 1 star review? Their Partisan anti-Trump articles ridiculous, they are on the wrong side of truth and the wrong side of history.",bad
Predictable hacks.,bad
"I am a long time subscriber to Texas Monthly and have received the past two monthly issues previously, Why would I want to re-read the same old crap?",bad
I have not received 1 copy yet.  How can I give it anything else?  I will probably enjoy it once that happens.,bad
"I have not received this magazine, so I can not write a review>

"I haven't received my magazine. I paid for it November 1, 2007. I'm not happy about this.",bad
"I am unable to review the product PC World, I haven't heard anything from the publisher or received a copy yet.",bad
Their magazine is more like a virus than a magazine. I have been trying for months to stop their spam emails.,bad
I was disappointed with the content of the magazine. I guess it was a little to high brow for me.,bad
"way too many ads, and not enough articles.",bad
Not really conservative  More like multitrillion dollar neoconservative armchair warriors.,bad
I personally did not like the style this magazine portrayed.,bad
It is all bout selling high end stuff. Not much useful here.,bad
Pretty pictures and ads - mostly ads.,bad
"Left wing, self hating, pinko socialist commy rag. This has nothing to do with the real Texas.",bad
I bought so that i can show it to my 10 year old son....its littered with tobacco advertisements and very little content.,bad
Cannot find it. Would like to cancel it. I like print magazines only. Ordered it by mistake.,bad
When will my first issue arrive?,bad
"WON'T OPEN ON KINDLE, WON'T ACCEPT ANY PASSWORD TO VERIFY ACCT ON CNTRAVELER WEBSITE. FORGET THIS ONE!",bad
This magazine did not appealed to me.,bad
"90% ads, no good articles.  Just your regular left slanted, east coast magazine.  Even if your view is leaning left, be ready to read the last months big headline from MSNBC.",bad
Not my style-way to busy.,bad
Ordered my subscription of month ago still haven't gotten it... And now you're asking me to rate it... So I will rate this a big zero,bad
There are way too many cigarettes and alcohol order this 9  year old. We had that talk years a go but still. The  articles are intriguing to him.,bad

got back to the 70s really ugly ideas,bad
I can't review the Monthly at this time; simply I ain't received it.  LOL,bad
STILL waiting for 1st issue to arrive!,bad
I did not need a renewal and do not appreciate your doing so.,bad
this was hard to cancel. I canceled my old subscription which had expired and the new one came through automaticaly!,bad
"very big waste of money, wouldn't take it again even if it was free",bad
"Mostly ads anyway, this magazine is only for the wealthy.  I have better ways of spending my money than wasting $200 on a throw pillow.",bad
Too many  pictures of celebrities not enough stories,bad
Again I didn't order this,bad
Different since the new company bought the original US Weekly out and changed their staff.,bad
I could not take looking at this anymore than 10 minutes. It was full of articles and pictures of shallowness. Our country is in deep trouble if we listen to these airhead!!,bad
I have still not received even the 1st copy. I ordered & paid for it several weeks ago.,bad
"Subscribed through Amazon for one year from July 2014 to July 2015. Got automatically renewed in April 2015 without notice, three months before it is supposed to renew.",bad
unusefull,bad
I don't like Texas Monthly.  Never have.  Some people want it just 'cause it's about Texas but it's not worth it.  Read somebody else's copy.,bad
"Four months after sale and still not the first issue. My subscription must be in limbo-land,",bad
"Ordered a subscription on March 7th, as of April 9th, have only received one issue. Item is now listed as ""unavailable"". Rip off.",bad
I have no idea how I ordered this for a whole year. I don't even look at it that much. Do not like it,bad
"They must be really desperate for ideas, or really want to push this product. Is this the best they could come up with.",bad
No info for print subscriber to assist in understanding digital policy?  You just  want me to pay...again?  Not everyone buys Apple.,bad
Says it was delivered to my iPhone but i don't have an iphone. I wanted it to go to my kindle?????,bad
"Sadly No, it didn't. We only received half of our issues even after contacting them twice.",bad
Liberal magazine full of gossip.,bad
Disappointed.,bad
Trashy magazine written by trashy people. Complete garbage.,bad
This was a pop up notice from the Kindle app on my phone.  Seriously?  Why would I want a gossip mag?,bad
I did not order this magazine and I do not want it. Do not under any circumstances auto renew the subscription.,bad
Still having technical difficulties processing my subscription?  It's been 6 months!,bad
it never downloadedd on my kindle so i didn't experience anything with this product i very sad because i love the kardshians (female) talking,bad
Horrible. None of the stories are real. Another tabloid rag mag. Won't be renewing. Good thing I only paid 5 bucks.... That's all it's worth for a year.,bad
Crap on toast,bad
Not worth your time,bad
I am still waiting on this magazine.  Was my subscribtion lost?  Please advise.,bad
There was nothing classy about the homes or anything else..This wasn't the old House Beautiful that I remember..Another $15.00 ill spent.,bad
It didn't download on my tablet,bad
Totally liberal and one-sided. I can't stand how biased this magazine is. Awful.,bad
Got three magazines then charged for a renewal of 15.00 so ends up costing 5 dollars a copy and is mostly advertisements. Very Dissapointed,bad
I was hoping there would be inspiring photos however most photos are so staged that it is not practical in real everyday life design.,bad
"I bought the kindle subscription version, it sucks because of the extremely slow download speed. I will cancel it.",bad
"It was a really ""slick"" mag....way to many ads.....no fun projects...bla. comerical.bla bla bla bla bla. bla bla bla bla",bad
Recieved first issue.  Page fell out.  Many pages aren't printed probably and offset.  Need a new printer or they are passing off inferior copies.,bad
"terrible, it is not the popular science I remember....and I cant unsubscribe.....TERRIBLE.....DONT BUY",bad
Written for 90 year old men waiting in dentist offices.  Just awful.,bad
about 95% advertising...I cancelled it...,bad

"In my opinion, it doesn't have alot of content and might as well subscribe to their facebook page and get it there for free",bad
"Ordered House Beautiful on December 8,2009 - but haven't seen one page of it yet.  Where is it???",bad
Loved it. Had time to reflect and use the strokes outlined. Took some of the pages and started a book to refer to.,bad
This magazine used to be cutting edge...  now its one big advertisement... 34 full page adds out of 88 for one issue... its soI used to look forward to each issue.  Not anymore!,bad
Credit card charged over two months ago and no magazine yet. How about a refund?,bad
Ordered since 27/11/09. Still no mag 31/01/10. I'm still hopeful though. Ordered Cosmo which is by same pulisher and received last week in December.,bad
"I have yet to receive my first issue.  I am looking forward to receiving

"It has been more than a month, but I still have not received House Beautiful magazine yet.",bad
"Great content, but Kindle format is no good.  Kindle formar too hard to use for magazines.  This mag needs its own app, like the excellent Business Week app.  Am returning it.",bad
a LARGE waste of TIME and MONEY!!!!,bad
"No cover!!!
No table of contents!!!
This is unaceptable!!!
And this is the only one edition for the Kindle!!!
This is Amazon at its worst!!! (+DRM!!!)",bad
Magazine is so thin now.  Not worth it.,bad
Warning! Kindle Fire won't bookmark your page and remember where you stopped reading. Returns to page one when you return to magazine. Makes this mag close to useless.,bad
"I have still not recieved my subscription yet you ask for a review of the product
? Isn't this a poor business practice",bad
"Please let me know when this was sent out, as we have not received it yet.
We ordered the Magazine Family Handyman, and have not received as of this

I have ordered this magazine for more than 7 weeks and I still haven't received the first copy.  What takes it so long???,bad
Hippie nonsense speciously reasoned liberal mouthpiece tripe.  TRIPE!,bad
A lot of ads.  Years ago I enjoyed this magazine.  It is not the same.,bad
i ordered this product for Xmas and have yet to receive an issue.  Amazon sold but magazine did not deliver.,bad
I would like to give a review but have not received anything to date. I would have expected to receiove a copy but nothing yet?,bad
I have submitted three subscriptions in the past three years and I  have never received a single copy.  How about that.,bad
Bonnier is not my recommendation for a Magazine subscription provider,bad
"too many ads and not enough content as expected
Not really science in it.",bad
"Although the magazine is great, it takes Amazon almost 3 months from the order date until the first issue is received. That is an unheard of amount of time to process any order!",bad
I cancelled the subscripton before it began because i found another offer at half the price.,bad
"This used to be a great weekly, but now it is hard to tell the ads from the news.  This is intentional.  I will not renew my subscription.",bad

"It you live in Canada be warned,magazine is always late by at least one issue,their customer service very unhelpful. buy it at the newsstand.",bad
"Newsweek used to be a pretty good, balenced magazine. Now it's about 60% ads 30% pictures and 10% ""news"" that always seem to be written like an editorial. Don't recommend anymore.",bad
Have just cancelled my subscription after many years.  Newsweek is no longer an objective news magazine.,bad
STICK WITH THE MAGAZINE.  FINE PRINT ON (SO CALLED CLUB) COST YOU BIG BUCKS.,bad
"What is the point of selling an item for Kindle that is NOT compatible with Kindle? Really, geniuses?",bad
item not yet received even though order was placed 69 days ago. no contact from company.,bad
do not waste your time on this pos,bad
I don't think they synced with my current subscription like they stated. They would ...so one star....I like the magazine a lot...,bad
"over 50% advertisements, like a comic book, not a mag",bad
Am a long time reader. Home Theater is a great publication. Just not sure why the magazine isn't supported on Kindle of Android...,bad
The magazine itself was a good read. I now have a very expired magazine I can't get rid of.,bad
I can't read this magazine anymore. It is written by and for high school students who don't like to read. I am canceling this and subscribing to the Economist.,bad

unable to access on Kindle,bad
"If you must read a news magazine, read Time....it's a lot better!",bad
"As soon as I downloaded this magazine my kindle went slowerer and slowerer. Not to mention,it has a horrible topic. Also I think they read this book in hell",bad
Not my cup of tea,bad
Recent issue contained obscene advertizing,bad
"Wired used to be a great magazine. Recently, its become overly political and its articles have been reduced in quality and quantity. Save yourself the money. Even if its on sale.",bad
"Great content, lousy design. The magazine is often impossible to read. I feel bad for the writers who spend so much time on their stories.",bad
"Doesn't work on Kindle Paperwhite 7th Generation. If it becomes available, I will be happy to subscribe.",bad
Could not download.,bad
Once upon a time WIRED wrote articles that focused on technology. The End.,bad
"It's a fabulous magazine, but it is unreadable on my Kindle.  The type is ridiculously small and unreadable.  The format is wrong for Kindle.",bad
Its nothing but ads. Seriously,bad
Not what I expected...Will cancel.,bad
Cumbersome to read on kindle fire...print too small even after switching to text only.  Also seemingly more ads than useful content,bad
"too many ads, no real, useful contents.",bad
was not for me,bad
Not as convenient as a paper magazine - barely look at it,bad
Disappointed in articles.,bad
Not able to download on Paperwhite!!! What else is Paperwhite for if it cannot download ALL Kindle materials? Disgusting.,bad
I look forward to receiving this magazine each month so I can throw it directly into the garbage. 99% adds with 1% fluff content. Awful waste of paper.,bad
Cheap paer,bad
I thought there would be much more journaling.  It is all pictures.  Not my cup of tea at all.,bad
"Vogue has sunk to the level of a tabloid.  Fashions are extreme and silly
I want to cancel my subscription, but can't seem to get to that page.  Help!!!",bad
Anorexic looking women  kind of depressing. Few articles are worth reading.,bad
"Received first issue, then an automatic refund... they stopped the magazine print. Sad. Because I liked it.",bad
"The magazine is 90% ads, oh and even the articles are ads in disguise... Don't waste your money.",bad
Would have given it a 0 if possible because I could not download it to my Apple Air.  Send emails asking for help without reply.  Please give me a refund for my subscription!,bad
90% advertising - it's hard to find anything that resembles an article,bad
The subscription is 5 stars but the 2015 Kindle no longer supports the Wired App which means there is no way to read or download past issues that were already purchased.,bad
Magazine went defunct a month after purchase.  Publisher won't respond to questions about remaining subscription term.,bad
"Love the magazine, have been a loyal subscriber for 15 years.  However, the magazine is now out of print--no further issues will be printed (sad day!).",bad
I am shocked by the number of cigarette ads in the magazine. This prevents me from enjoying it and it also does not allow me to give it to my children or others to enjoy.,bad
Full of liberal garbage. All of the articles have a liberal slant to them.  I will not renew and do not recommend it.,bad
Another magazine just for advertisements,bad
"Sales Paper, lots of advertisement, very short on substance, cancelled after first issue. This Publication has lost a lot in the past ten years.......",bad
And then it ends sad,bad
The website is easier to read than the magazine on the web.,bad

Way too  many  add's ..,bad
not enough info,bad

A poor substitute for the image-laden actual magazine.,bad

Not good at all.,bad
Way too many ads and most articles read like they are for a thirty year old dating woman not a teenage girl.,bad

It stopped coming to my address.,bad
I bought this magazine subscription as I thought it would be like NY Mag but its incredibly superficial. I wouldn't recommend it.,bad
This magazine has too many advertisements and very little good contents!,bad
"I don't like the contents, very poorly put together compared to many other magazines.",bad
Why pay for a book of ads? There was like 4 stories and 30 pages of ads.,bad
"This magazine isn't what it used to be. It is much thinner with less information, other than advertising, than the Seventeen my mother subscribed me to as a teen.",bad
It won't download wirelessly or to my computer for transfer via USB.  I only bought a single issue but are now leery of buying magazines.  This one says Kindle Edition.,bad
I am not able to read it. My Kindle will not let me turn the pages.,bad
"Didn't order it, just called to have it stopped. Looked at it and not interested.",bad
I originally started reading this site to the computer related content.  You have seriously gone downhill.  I think I shall cancel my subscription.,bad
Literally the worst publication I've ever read. Over 75% of the magazine is filled with full page ads.,bad
just a magazine about tech,bad
Horrible magazine,bad

Great  magazine but I cant make  it work  on my Kindle  fire waste  of money,bad

"I love Vogue magazine, but why do they insist on renewing in April when the subscription goes until July?  Next year I will take it off the auto renewal format.",bad
Some pages never download I never see pictures I never get it again I pay two times here and on the store,bad
Didn't arrive on my device. No customer support.,bad
Signed up for a low rate but the autorenew came in at a much higher rate and decided to cancel the subscription can get it much cheaper elsewhere.,bad
I can't review this product yet since I have not received it yet.  It's Los Angeles Magazine....but I haven't received a copy yet although I ordered it in April,bad
what drivel - one large makeup ad,bad
99% product advertisements than informative articles.,bad
Cancelled my subscription.  Heavy political tilt.  I just want info about the technology - not why we should or should not be adopting it.,bad
Lost its quality and consumed by ads,bad
Never was able to download. This just never worked on my Kindle. Disappointed. Unsure what the problem was just that there was one,bad
i only received 2 issues!!!(Oct and April) I thought I am going to have an issue for each month...it is nonsense for me...am i misunderstanding the meaning of 1-yr renewal?,bad
I ordered a month ago still no magazine....I wasn't aware it took so long for a subscription. I really like vogue magazine I just wish I could get it some time soon to read it.,bad
"didn't realize it was an automatic renewal, and doesn't say who the recipient is. I sent this gift to several last year.",bad
"Never got this product..

"I only received one issue of this magazine, really don't even remember ordering it in the first place. Did not like it.",bad
"I'd like to find out about getting a refund, since I've been charged for a magazine subscription without getting any actual issues.  This is a very disappointing ""special offer"".",bad
"This magazine will no longer be published in a print edition after 08/2012. Online content only.
Glad I just renewed my subscription!!",bad
Not really a magazine for me . Ok maybe for my Neice.,bad
This magazine is filled with ads and the articles are rarely very interesting (unless you make millions). Not worth my precious time!,bad
Was disappointed .  Contest let them use Photoshop.  I thought a good photographer did it all with camera settings.,bad
This is for prows .way above me. I will cancel at the end of my year.,bad
I find the fashions terrible and will end my free trial subscription.,bad
"Personal preference, I was looking for more on credit cards, ways to save and handling debt. I'm not really into investing. This is a great magazine for those who are though.",bad
I haven't received a magazine yet.  Please look into this and advise.  Thank you.,bad
"All ads, not much content",bad
Great if you photoshop every picture you take.,bad
Still waiting for it to come it's been four weeks. I am starting to be annoyed. Come on seventeen. Hurry up.,bad
Was not contacted that the magazine was on an auto renewal.  Felt magazine should have contacted and made sure I wanted to auto renewal.,bad
I'm sorry but is not for me,bad
"Hey Garton, how much were you paid to write a 5 star review? It certainly detracts from your own credentials. The real reviews say it all. I'll pass.",bad
"I hate how the beauty tips don't consider girls with short hair. Also, the fashion it terrible. Who wears stuff like that?",bad
I have not yet received the first issue - I ordered this on 12/4/07 and it is now 1/7/07.,bad
No auto renewal. Cancel.,bad
I ordered this magazine many months ago and I have only received one edition.,bad
"Wish I had not mailed my check.  Most boring magazine I
Have ever seen. Anorexic models with pouty faces, none of
Them happy with life, I guess. Please
Refund my money.",bad
This business of automatically renewing a magazine and making it difficult to cancel is the reason I will never buy a subscription from Amazon again,bad
I haven't received any of the copies and I don't know of any contact person or company to complain about this problem. Bogus!,bad
"Please, few weeks I sed I don't want to renew the subscription to Wired magazine!!",bad
This is not a magazine.  There is no content.  It does not seem that the issues were delivered either. Save your money,bad
Ordered this back in late December as a gift and receiver hasn't gotten a single issue and it's March 18!!! NOT HAPPY!!,bad
I recieved one magazine and then it stopped coming. Total ripoff.,bad
Signed up at a low rate but the renewal rate was too high. Decided to cancel subscription due to rate change.,bad
Mag has nothing but glorified ads. You'll get more info from your neighbors kid than from this promotional tag. Seriously!!!,bad
I would not know if I enjoyed my subscription because I NEVER RECEIVED IT. not one copy. now they want me to re-subscribe. UH...NO...thank you.,bad
"I've only received two copies of this magazine.  I ordered it in December, and it's now August.  No idea what happened.",bad

"I ordered a subscription and 3 months later, I still have not received a copy yet.",bad
I love Field & Stream. But I only received one issue about two months after I ordered.,bad
Don't waste your money on this magazine. It contains too many ads and boring articles.,bad
"Interesting, informative articles and exotic recipes.",bad
good magazine it just never shows up on time,bad
I ordered the yearlong subscription in January; I've received one magazine. Ridiculous.,bad
I get my subscription very late in the month or not at all. Not consistent.,bad
I Have not had the opportunity to read Wired. I have not received it! Where is my order?,bad
I do not like this magazine.  I only agreed to the subscription because it was free.  I would like to STOP its delivery.  DO NOT CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD.,bad
"This Kindle version must be specifically for Kindle Fire because I could not load it up on my Android, Kindle, or Nexus 7, only my iPod. So beware.",bad
"Although I love Wired magazine, I have yet to receive any of my subscription through Amazon in the mail.",bad
I purchased this magazine and one other for my husband for Christmas back in October . He got two issues and nothing more. Very disappointin,bad
